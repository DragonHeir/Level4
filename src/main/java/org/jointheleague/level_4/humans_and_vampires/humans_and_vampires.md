/**
Exercise:
1. Write out Person class with attributes name and age. Include constructor and accessors.
2. Make Person class in Eclipse using autogenerate for accessors.
3. Make a class called Demographics that averages the ages of all the people on a List with a getAverageAge() method.
4. But that only works for one year so, change Person to store dateOfBirth instead of age. Fix it without without changing Demographics class.
5. Add class Vampire that extends Person with attribute ageAtDeath.
6. Write getAge() method for Vampire. This is Polymorphism, muhahahaha!
